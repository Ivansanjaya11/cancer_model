Evidence is mounting that suggests the putative role of microbiota in the carcinogenesis as well as in modulating the efficacy and activity of anticancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies) in a large number of hematological and solid tumors. However, few data are available regarding the interactions between prostate cancer and microbiome so far, in particular in terms of the impact of microbiota on disease development, pathogenesis, and response to medical treatments in this genitourinary malignancy. Herein, we provide an overview of current knowledge, novel insights and emerging therapeutic approaches related to gastrointestinal and genitourinary microbiome in prostate cancer patients, especially focusing on available evidence and published trials on this topic.', 'Early detection and management of prostate cancer has evolved over the past decade, with a focus now on harm minimisation and reducing overdiagnosis and', 'Early detection and management of prostate cancer has evolved over the past decade, with a focus now on harm minimisation and reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, given the proven improvements in survival from randomised', 'Early detection and management of prostate cancer has evolved over the past decade, with a focus now on harm minimisation and reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, given the proven improvements in survival from randomised controlled trials.
