      "['During the past recent years, various therapies emerged in the era of breast cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease in which genetic and environmental factors are involved. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are the main player in the aggressiveness of different tumors and also, these cells are the main challenge in cancer treatment. Moreover, the major obstacle to achieve an effective treatment is resistance to therapies. There are various types of treatment for breast cancer (BC) patients. Therefore, in this review, we present the current treatments, novel approaches such as antibody-drug conjugation systems (ADCs), nanoparticles (albumin-, metal-, lipid-, polymer-, micelle-based nanoparticles), and BCSCs-based therapies. Furthermore, prognostic and predictive biomarkers will be discussed also biomarkers that have been applied by some tests such as Oncotype DX, Mamm αPrint, and uPA/PAI-1 are regarded as suitable prognostic and predictive factors in breast cancer.', 'Breast cancer is the most common global malignancy and the leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite this, undergraduate and postgraduate exposure to breast cancer is limited, impacting on the ability of clinicians to accurately recognise, assess and refer appropriate patients. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pathology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, referral pathways and management of breast cancer in the UK. It also describes how to conduct a thorough clinical breast examination.', 'Breast cancer remains a worldwide public health dilemma and is currently the most common tumour in the globe. Awareness of breast cancer, public attentiveness, and advancement in breast imaging has made a positive impact on recognition and screening of breast cancer. Breast cancer is life-threatening disease in females and the leading cause of mortality among women population. For the previous two decades, studies related to the breast cancer has guided to astonishing advancement in our understanding of the breast cancer, resulting in further proficient treatments. Amongst all the malignant diseases, breast cancer is considered as one of the leading cause of death in post menopausal women accounting for 23% of all cancer deaths. It is a global issue now, but still it is diagnosed in their advanced stages due to the negligence of women regarding the self inspection and clinical examination of the breast. This review addresses anatomy of the breast, risk factors, epidemiology of breast cancer, pathogenesis of breast cancer, stages of breast cancer, diagnostic investigations and treatment including chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapies, hormone replacement therapy, radiation therapy, complementary therapies, gene therapy and stem-cell therapy etc for breast cancer.', 'Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies. Pathological image processing of breast has become an important means for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Using medical image processing to assist doctors to detect potential breast cancer as early as possible has always been a hot topic in the field of medical image diagnosis. In this paper, a breast cancer recognition method based on image processing is systematically expounded from four aspects: breast cancer detection, image segmentation, image registration, and image fusion. The achievements and application scope of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, CNN, and so on in breast cancer examination are expounded. The prospect of unsupervised learning and transfer learning for breast cancer diagnosis is prospected. Finally, the privacy protection of breast cancer patients is put forward.', 'INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is the second cancer frequently occurring worldwide of newly-diagnosed cancers. There is much evidence showing the influence of life style and environmental factors on the development of mammary gland cancer (high-fat diet, alcohol consumption, lack of physical exercise), the elimination of which (primary prevention) may contribute to a decrease in morbidity and mortality. Secondary prevention, comprising diagnostic tests (e.g. mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, breast self-examination, as well as modern and more precise imaging methods) help the early detection of tumours or lesions predisposing to tumours. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study paper is to review current knowledge and reports regarding primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer. STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: It is estimated that nearly 70% of malign tumours are caused by environmental factors, whereas in breast cancer this percentage reaches 90-95%. There are national programmes established in many countries to fight cancer, where both types of prevention are stressed as serving to decrease morbidity and mortality due to cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer prevention is currently playing a key role in the fight against the disease. Behaviour modification, as well as greater awareness among women regarding breast cancer, may significantly contribute towards reducing the incidence of this cancer. Another important aspect is the number of women undergoing diagnostic tests, which still remains at an unsatisfactory level.', 'The progesterone receptor (PR) modulates estrogen receptors α (ERα) action in breast cancer; it is an upregulated target gene of ER, and its expression is dependent on estrogen. PR is also a valuable prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, especially in hormone-positive breast cancer. High expression of PR is more frequently observed in tumors with a better baseline prognosis (ie, luminal A) than tumors with a poor baseline prognosis (ie, luminal B). In the following review, we present the role of PR in breast cancer, including the genomic characteristics and pathways in breast cancer, PR and endocrine therapy.', 'Breast cancer remains a public-health issue on a global scale. We report new information about the disease from the past 5 years. Early age at first birth, increasing parity, and tamoxifen use are related to long-term lifetime reduction in breast-cancer risk. Ductal carcinomas in situ has been suggested to be renamed ductal intraepithelial neoplasia to emphasise its non-life-threatening nature. An alternative approach, the progenitor/stem cell theory, predicts that only some tumour cells cause cancer progression and that these should be targeted by treatment. Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues, respectively. Additionally, MRI, lymphatic mapping, the nipple-sparing mastectomy, partial breast irradiation, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and adjuvant treatments are promising for subgroups of breast-cancer patients. Although tamoxifen can be offered for endocrine-responsive disease, aromatase inhibitors are increasingly used. Assessment of potential molecular targets is now important in primary diagnosis. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and other drugs with anti-angiogenesis properties are currently undergoing preclinical investigations.', 'Understanding breast cancer treatment options can help family physicians care for their patients during and after cancer treatment. This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.', \"Despite dramatic advances in cancer research setting, breast cancer remains a major health problem and represents currently a top biomedical research priority. Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, and its incidence and mortality rates are expected to increase significantly the next years. Recently the researchers' interest has been attracted by breast cancer arising in young women. Current evidence suggests that in women aged <45\\xa0years, breast cancer is unquestionably the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. This type of cancer seems to be highly heterogeneous and has potentially aggressive and complex biological features. However, management strategies, recommendations and options are not age based and the 'complex' biology of this type of cancer remains uncertain and unexplored. In this review, we summarize the latest scientific information on breast cancer arising in young women highlighting the heterogeneity and the complex nature of this type of cancer.\", 'The analysis of the causes that have given rise to a change in tendency in the incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer in the last few decades generates important revelations regarding the role of breast screening, the regular application of adjuvant therapies and the change of risk factors. The benefits of early detection have been accompanied by certain adverse effects, even in terms of an excessive number of prophylactic mastectomies. Recently, several updates have been published on the recommendations in breast cancer screening at an international level. On the other hand, the advances in genomics have made it possible to establish a new molecular classification of breast cancer. Our aim is to present an updated overview of the epidemiological situation of breast cancer, as well as some relevant issues from the point of view of diagnosis, such as molecular classification and different strategies for both population-based and opportunistic screening.', 'Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranks second among causes for cancer related death in women. Evidence in literature has shown that the past and ongoing research has an enormous implication in improving the clinical outcome in breast cancer. This has been attributed to the progress made in the realm of screening, diagnosis and therapeutic strategies engaged in breast cancer management. However, poor prognosis in TNBC and drug resistance presents major inhibitions which are also current challenges for containing the disease. Similarly, a focal point of concern is the rising rate of breast cancer incidence and mortality among the population of under developed world. In this chapter, an overview of the current practices for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and associated impediments has been provided.', 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the United States and around the world. Although widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapeutic and hormonal agents has improved mortality from breast cancer, it remains challenging to determine on an individual basis who will benefit from such treatments and who will be likely to encounter toxicities. With the rising costs of healthcare and the introduction of new targeted therapies, use of biomarkers has emerged as a method of assisting with breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic response, and surveillance of disease during and after treatment. In the following review, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers, their utility in the management of patients with breast cancer, and current recommendations regarding their clinical use will be discussed.', 'Breast cancer (BC) genetics has become a fundamental aspect of BC management [...].']\n"
